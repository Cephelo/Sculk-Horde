<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Gravemind System</h4>
<p>The Gravemind is the omnipresent entity that controls and coordinates the Sculk Horde . The Gravemind only comes into existence in the second stage of evolution of the Sculk Horde . The Gravemind will attempt to strategically use its resources to spread the horde and counter attackers. The Gravemind is able to remember various interactions between the Horde and mobs and use this information to determine how much of a threat a mob is. The Horde will adapt uniquely to mobs based on this memory system which can result in the Horde attacking specific mobs on sight.</p>
